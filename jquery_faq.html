    <dt>How did Yellowstone get its name?</dt>
    <dd>Yellowstone National Park is named after the Yellowstone River,
        the major river running through the park.
        According to French-Canadian trappers in the 1800s,
        they asked the name of the river from the Minnetaree tribe,
        who live in what is now eastern Montana.
        They responded “Mi tse a-da-zi,” which literally translates as “Rock Yellow River.”
        The trappers translated this into French as “Roche Jaune” or “Pierre Jaune.” In 1797,
        explorer-geographer David Thompson used the English translation—“Yellow Stone.”
        Lewis and Clark called the Yellowstone River by the French and English forms. Subsequent use formalized the name as “Yellowstone.

        Until 1994, Yellowstone (at 2.2 million acres) was the largest national park in the contiguous United States.
