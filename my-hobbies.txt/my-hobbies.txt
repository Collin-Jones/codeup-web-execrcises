I love to play video games, play paintball when I can, I also love to travel, and marital arts. Some of my favorite games to play are Apex Legends, Rocket League, Skyrim with 200+ mods, and then Sqaud with my military friends. 
I almost played on a paintball team but I went to China for half a year for martial arts.
