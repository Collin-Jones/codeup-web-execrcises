<h1>Hello, World!</h1>

<div id = "main-content">
    <p>"Humankind cannot gain anything without first giving something in return. To obtain, something of equal value must be lost. <br>That is Alchemy's first law of Equivalent Exchange. In those days, we really believed that to be the world's one and only truth."</p>
</div>

<p>This is a quote from <strong><em>Fullmetal Alchemist</em></strong></p>
